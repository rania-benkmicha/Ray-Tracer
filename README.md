# Ray Tracer C++ Project

## Compilation and running the project

A C++ project for rendering time-invariant ray-traced scenes. Features interactive light source control via mouse input and the ability to save results as BMP images.

The project can be compiled using the makefile using the **make all** command
Then, we should issue the command **./raytracing** in order to run the project.

## Project scenarios :
Once the project is running, we should select the file number 1 or 2 which corresponds to these both methods :

**Scenario 1**: Visualization of the animation by controlling the light source with the mouse.

**Scenario 2** : Visualization of a time-invariant result with the option to save it as a BMP image

**FYI** : Both files 1.txt qnd 2.txt represent the scene objects.
