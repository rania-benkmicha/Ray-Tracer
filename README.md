#Ray Tracer C++ Project

##Compilation and running the project
The project can be compiled using the makefile using the **make all** command
Then, we should issue the command **./raytracing** in order to run the project.

## Project scenarios :
Once the project is running, we should select the file number 1 or 2 which corresponds to these both methods :

**Scenario 1 **: Visualization of the animation by controlling the light source with the mouse.
**Scenario 2** : Visualization of a time-invariant result with the option to save it as a BMP image

**FYI** : Both files 1.txt qnd 2.txt represent the scene objects.
